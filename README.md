Coin-Trend Bot

[Features]
- This bot watches the coin gecko trending search throughout the day and then posts them to a website so we dont miss any trending coins/tokens.
- Counts the number of times that a coin is in the trending and rank them by the interval set by user.
- They filtered the lsit from all cryptos and this filters their list against itself so basically an extra layer of DD focusing on trendind volume/activity of said token.

[Features To-Do List]
- Write a proper ReadMe!
- Make a web page hosted version using FLASK + HTML/CSS (Inline? / Single Fie?)
- Reverse order of list
- Top 3 in 24, 48, 72 hours, etc...
- Integrate with Discord and/or Telegram bot(s).
- Host on server with cheap 99.9% uptime for constant monitoring of new data (tokens/coins) input.
